- Investments (Primary Key: id, GSI: userId, GSI: campaignId)  
- Documents (Primary Key: id, GSI: ownerId)
```

### **2. API Gateway Configuration**
Add the new Lambda functions to your API Gateway with proper routes:
```
- /campaigns/* ‚Üí CampaignHandler
- /investments/* ‚Üí InvestmentHandler  
- /documents/* ‚Üí DocumentHandler
```

### **3. Environment Variables**
Configure the following environment variables for each function:
```
- CAMPAIGNS_TABLE

```

### **4. IAM Permissions**
Ensure Lambda functions have proper permissions:
- DynamoDB read/write access
- S3 read access for document handling
- CloudWatch logs access

### **5. Deploy Functions**
```bash
cd /path/to/poligrain_app
amplify push
```
